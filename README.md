# openspending-osnabrueck

OpenSpending offers a tool for validating your table's quality. It does not only tell you whether you fulfilled the minimum requirements but you'll also get hints on how to address issues in the case of invalid files. [here](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/goodtables-py) you find the github-repository for the GoodTables Data Validator.
